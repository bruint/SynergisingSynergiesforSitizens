# SynergisingSynergiesforSitizens

Hey There,

Thanks for taking a look at Synergising Synergies for Sitizens.

If you'd like to take a look at our finished product it's pretty simple. 

All you need to do is download 2 files:
 * http://www.tableau.com/products/reader
 * https://github.com/bruint/SynergisingSynergiesforSitizens/blob/master/Tableau/Synergy%20-%20v4.twbx?raw=true

There are two tabs, the first is just the consumption of all suburbs in W.A. The second "Differential" is more interesting because it allows you to see which suburbs have a positive or negative effect on the grid. You can even adjust the PV efficiency and usable roof space on the fly!
 
Enjoy!
